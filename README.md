#####Python in TouchDesigner |Printing| 

**What is Python?**
It is a high level scripting language that allows us to do different kind of operations with our computer

**Python in TouchDesigner**
How to use the scripting element of Python to let us achieve particular ends.

**Use Text DAT to code**

You can multiply using Python by using a variable or a float and multi/add/subtr/divide it
  
  my_number = 2
  print(my_number * 2)
                       
                       outcome = 4
                       
When you multiply with a Boolean then you are multiplying 1(True) or 0(False)
  
  my_bool = True
  print (my_bool *2)
                      
                      outcome = 2
  my_bool = False
  print (my_bool *2)
                      
                      outcome = 0
                      
 When you want to print something in multipile lines then...
 
 
 /n = new Line
  
  
  ex. I can imagine a magical situation n/where I want to print n/out something on multiple lines n/right?
                      
                      
                      outcome = I can imagine a magical situation
                                where I want to print
                                out something on multiple lines
                                right?

**Terms:**
Print - Prints whatever we have inside the quotes
  ex. print ("Hello World")
String - A string is a list of characters that are in order that don't include any numbers.
  ex. print ("This is a string")
Integer - A Whole number                (look at C# notes)
  ex. print ("5")
Float - A number with a decimal         (look at C# notes)
  ex. print ("5.1")
Booleans - True or False Statements. They are evaluated with 1's and 0's.     (look at C# notes)
  ex. print ("True")  or print ("False")
Variables - It is nothing but just reserves memory location to store value    (look at C# notes)
  ex. text= "Hello stranger"     text is the vatiable
